The application code lives in `src/app`. This application uses `gulp` and
CofeeScript. You can install gulp with:

    $ npm install -g gulp

Once it's installed, you can watch code in `src/` and run specs on any file
change with:

    $ gulp

Remember to run `npm install` before running `gulp` for the first time.

## Specs
Specs live in `src/spec/`.
